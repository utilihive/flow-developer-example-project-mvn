= GridOS Connect Flow Developer Example Project
:toc:
:sectnums:

== Overview

This example codebase serves as an introduction to the Utilihive Flow Developer SDK while demonstrating common use cases and best practices.
Developers new to writing integration flows should clone this repository and refer to the official https://pages.github.software.gevernova.com/grid-platform/connect-docs-site/internal/connect/latest/[Utilihive documentation] for additional help.

== Example Flows

The example project includes a series of working sample flows that demonstrate features like creating REST endpoints, handing payloads off to other flows, and mapping JSON compliant data.
These flow specifications can be found in the link:src/main/kotlin/flowexamples[main/kotlin/flowexamples] directory and are numbered `e01`, `e02`, etc.

Each sample flow also has a corresponding unit test in the link:src/test/kotlin/flowexamples[test/kotlin/flowexamples] directory.
It is important to test flows during the development process, which is why the SDK includes a robust testing framework and local test server to deploy flows on.

For a more detailed walkthrough of the example flows and test features, check out the https://pages.github.software.gevernova.com/grid-platform/connect-docs-site/internal/connect/latest/getting-started/examples/e01/[Getting Started section] of the Utilihive documentation.

== Installation

The Connect SDK is a Maven dependency of the example project and requires https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html[Java 17].
You also need to add the software access credentials from your Utilihive license to the Maven settings to access the SDK.

Create or edit the file located at `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml` on your computer and add the following `<server>` element:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>utilihive-sdk</id>
      <username>YOUR USERNAME</username>
      <password>YOUR PASSWORD</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
----

The flows and tests are written in Kotlin and need the https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA] installed to run them.
